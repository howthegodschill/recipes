# Recipes
My repository for Autopkg recipes

## Signed Recipes
All of the signed recipes utilize the **PkgSigner** Autopkg processor, which I've included with the recipes.

Original version here:
[PkgSigner.py](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/blob/5a1e497a33f02bb5b21eebd81cf0169a664cd2e3/Code/autopkglib/PkgSigner.py)
